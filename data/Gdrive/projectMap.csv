"SUB Solar Panels","solar",45.665727,-111.047772,"ASMSU sponsored a Solar Array system for the Strand Union Building. Independent Power Systems installed a 4.32 kilowatt six panel solar array system on the south elevation of the Strand Union Building. The PV (Photo Voltaic) panels were installed just above the awnings and generate approximately 5500 kw/h per year. An educational kiosk was set up inside the south entry of the SUB as well. Part of this education entails a monitoring system for the solar array. The work was completed by April 13, 2012 just in time to celebrate Earth Week."
